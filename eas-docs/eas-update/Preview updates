# Preview updates

_Learn how to preview updates in development, preview, and production builds._

Before deploying an update to production, you will often want to test it in a production-like environment. This guide will outline different approaches for previewing updates, and link out to more detailed guides for each approach.

## Previewing updates in development builds

Development builds are a great way to preview updates from pull requests, directly from the EAS dashboard, or from the built-in UI provided by the `expo-dev-client` library.

## Previewing updates in preview builds

Non-technical users will typically not want to interact with a development build, and they will want to test changes from a preview build on an [App store testing track](https://docs.expo.dev/review/overview/#app-store-testing-tracks) or [internal distribution](https://docs.expo.dev/review/overview/#internal-distribution-with-eas-build).

If your team is smaller, it may be sufficient to deploy a single preview build at a time to an app store testing track or internal distribution. You can then publish updates to the channel that is used by that preview build. [Learn more about preview builds](https://docs.expo.dev/review/overview/).

Alternatively, you can build a mechanism into your preview build that allows users to select a different update or channel to load. This can be useful in cases where the [app runtime](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/runtime-versions/) doesn't change often, and many different updates can be loaded in the same app. [Learn more](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/override/).

## Previewing updates in production builds

Before deploying an update to all end-users, some teams will want to first roll it out in production to a small set of internal users. One way this can be accomplished is by [overriding the update channel](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/override/) at runtime for a known subset of users. **Be sure to note the [security considerations](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/override/#security-considerations) before proceeding down this path.** Additionally, it is not recommended to use this approach for non-internal users because it makes it possible to get the app into a state where it must be uninstalled and reinstalled.

Another approach is to use a deployment pattern like the [Persistent Staging Flow](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/deployment-patterns/#persistent-staging-flow), which involves always having a version of your production app that points to a staging channel.
