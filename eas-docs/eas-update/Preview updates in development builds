# Preview updates in development builds

_Learn how to use the expo-dev-client library to preview a published EAS Update inside a development build._

[`expo-dev-client`](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) library allows launching different versions of a project by creating a development build. Any compatible EAS Update can be previewed in a development build.

This guide walks through the steps required to load and preview a published update inside a development build using the **Extensions** tab or constructing a specific Update URL.

## Prerequisites

- [Create a development build and install it](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/) on your device or Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.
- Make sure your development build has the [`expo-updates` library installed](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/getting-started/#configure-your-project).

## What is an Extensions tab

When using the `expo-updates` library inside a development build, the **Extensions** tab provides the ability to load and preview a published update automatically.

### Preview an update using the Extensions tab

<Step label="1">

Make non-native changes locally in your project and then [publish them using `eas update`](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/getting-started/#publish-an-update). The update will be published on a branch.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

After publishing the update, open your development build, go to **Extensions**, and tap **Login** to log in to your Expo account within the development build. This step is required for the **Extensions** tab to load any published updates associated with the project under your Expo account.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

After logging in, an EAS Update section will appear inside the **Extensions** tab with one or more of the latest published updates. Tap **Open** next to the update you want to preview.

</Step>

In the **Extensions** tab, you can view the list of all published updates for a branch. Tap the branch name in the **Extensions** tab.

## Preview an update using the EAS dashboard

You can also preview an update using the EAS dashboard by following the steps below:

- Click the published updated link in the CLI after running the command to publish an update. This will open the update's details on the **Updates** page in the EAS dashboard.
- Click **Preview**. This will open the **Preview** dialog.
- To preview the update, you can either scan the QR code with your device's camera or select a platform to [launch the update under **Open with Orbit**](https://docs.expo.dev/review/with-orbit/).

## Construct an update URL

As an alternative to the methods described in the previous sections, you can construct a specific URL to open your EAS Update in the development build. The URL will look like the following:

```bash
[slug]://expo-development-client/?url=[https://u.expo.dev/project-id]/group/[group-id]
# Example
my-app://expo-development-client/?url=https://u.expo.dev/675cb1f0-fa3c-11e8-ac99-6374d9643cb2/group/47839bf2-9e01-467b-9378-4a978604ab11
```

Let's break this URL to understand what each part does:

| Part of URL                                               | Description                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `slug`                                                    | The project's [slug](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#slug) found in the app config.                                           |
| `://expo-development-client/`                             | Necessary for the deep link to work with the [`expo-dev-client`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/dev-client/) library.                |
| `?url=`                                                   | Defines a `url` query parameter.                                                                                           |
| `https://u.expo.dev/675cb1f0-fa3c-11e8-ac99-6374d9643cb2` | This is the updates URL, which is inside the project's app config under [`updates.url`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#url). |
| `/group/47839bf2-9e01-467b-9378-4a978604ab11`             | The group ID of the update.                                                                                                |

Once you've constructed the URL, copy and paste it directly into the development build's launcher screen under **Enter URL Manually**.

Alternatively, you can [create a QR code for the URL](https://docs.expo.dev/more/qr-codes/) and scan it using your device's camera. When scanned, the URL will open up the development build to the specified channel.
